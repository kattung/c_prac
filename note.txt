* Integer sizes on 32 bit and 64 bit Linux

  +------------------+--------+--------+
  | type/executable  | 32 bit | 64 bit |
  +------------------+--------+--------+
  | short int        | 16 bit | 16 bit |
  | int              | 32 bit | 32 bit |
  | long int         | 32 bit | 64 bit |
  | long long int    | 64 bit | 64 bit |
  | size_t           | 32 bit | 64 bit |
  | void*            | 32 bit | 64 bit |
  +------------------+--------+--------+

  Note: A 32 bit executable can be used in a 64 bit user space
  (supposed a 32 bit loader and required shared libraries have
  been installed), a 32 bit user space can run on a 64 bit kernel
  and a 32 bit kernel can run on a 64 bit processor. So itâ€™s really
  the word length of the executable that counts.
